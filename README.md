👋 Hi, I’m @FuzzyWaffler

👀 I’m interested in ... Brewing, Plants, Mycelium, and automating life's more tedious tasks. Now, I'm also expanding into Herbal Oil extraction, Espresso machine design, Coffee Roasting, Website Development, and Training through Unity VR.

🌱 I’m currently learning ... How to code with modern tools. I come from an era when LAMP and WAMP were standard practice, and it’s exciting to dive into microservices and new ways to build websites and applications.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Nonprofit initiatives, especially with my startup, Brews Beyond Borders. We aim to empower communities by helping entrepreneurs establish breweries in regions where beer options are limited. Historically, breweries have strengthened communities, extending the shelf life of products and enhancing social ties, yet financial and knowledge barriers prevent some communities from developing these pillars.
